"Latavelha" is a discord bot with a bunch of small fun functions.

The bot uses the [discordjs](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

# TODO (wishlist)
- Command for dice rolling (coin flipping)
- Command for reminder in the future
- Help function that introduce the bot
- Bot randomly speaking about stuff (weather?)

- Unit tests and stuff like that
- Add permission checking for commands
- Change the "servechannel" command to allow bot to speak on some channels
- Replace "memory" with a proper getter and setter data structure
